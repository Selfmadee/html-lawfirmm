    <p>The Cochran Firm Los Angeles office holds a special place in the heart of the national organization.  The very same office that Johnnie Cochran opened in 1981 to continue the career he started in 1963 is the very same office his protégé’, Managing Attorney Brian Dunn, works to continue the legacy Mr. Cochran started so long ago.  As a constant reminder to our Los Angeles attorneys, Mr. Cochran’s office remains just how he left it in order to inspire them to work with the same tenacity on behalf of their clients.

        With experience helping clients in the areas of sexual harassment, wrongful death, personal injury, entertainment law, and criminal defense, the Los Angeles office is particularly well known for Managing Attorney Brian Dunn’s work in civil rights and police brutality.  Over 15 years after the passing of his mentor, Brian continues Mr. Cochran’s work to effect change in police policies and procedures across the state of California.  When he’s not standing up for the rights of his clients, Brian can be found discussing issues from the civil rights movement to the war on drugs and for profit prisons with distinguished guests like Connie Rice, John Sweeney, and Reverend James Lawson on his radio show ‘A Nation Divided’ on 790 KABC or at www.nationdividedradio.com.
